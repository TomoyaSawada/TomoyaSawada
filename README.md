Research on Generative AI for Industries, adopting various IoT devices  
Collaborate with: Rei Araki, Takaomi Hasegawa, Tadahiro Shidara, Keichi Yokoyama</summary>

   In this project, we investigates the potential of large language models (LLMs) for optimizing HVAC systems in real-world settings. While prior research has primarily focused on simulated environments, this study bridges the gap by deploying and evaluating an LLM-based control system in an actual office. The system collects real-time environmental data and occupant feedback on thermal comfort. This data, along with historical environmental and feedback information, is used to prompt the generative AI model, which predicts optimal HVAC setpoint temperatures throughout the day. The results demonstrate a significant reduction in power consumption (up to 47.92%, equivalent to 39.48 kWh) and a concurrent improvement in occupant comfort (up to 26.36%) compared to the baseline. Notably, regression analysis confirms that these improvements persist even after accounting for external factors such as outside temperature and occupancy. This study highlights the significant potential of generative AI for optimizing HVAC systems, enhancing both energy efficiency and occupant comfort in real-world scenarios. Future research will explore the scalability of this approach, targeting larger-scale building energy management systems in data centers and industrial facilities.

Research on Generative Adversarial Networks(GAN), Annotation System for Semantic Segmentation  
Collaborate with: Professor Antonio Torralba </summary>

   Generative Adversarial Networks(GANs) have been used to generate images with high resolution. However, the placement and detail of the individual parts were not natural. In this project, we developed a method based on the SPADE network to generate images with natural object placement and detail granularity. To overcome the limitations of GANs in generating detailed edges, a method was developed that utilizes CG as a base to clarify boundaries and applies real-world reconstructed textures to achieve high-resolution generated images.
   We investigated the effectiveness of GAN-based reconstruction methods for object generation by applying a method developed by MIT to the CityScape dataset. The generated objects were then used to train the state-of-the-art object detection method DetectoRS. We also evaluated the extent to which real-world data could be reduced without compromising accuracy by varying the proportion of real images in the training dataset. Results showed that reducing the proportion of real images by 50% led to a decrease in mAP (mean Average Precision) of only about 4%, demonstrating the potential of GAN-based data augmentation for reducing the need for large amounts of real-world data in object detection tasks.
   We also developed a tool for automatic annotation to enable a smooth transition from data aquisition to learning.

Advisors: Michael Jones, Tim Marks, Anoop Cherian, Teng-yok Lee and Alan Sullivan  </summary>

   In this project, I developed a variety of computer vision technologies: 
   - **Object Detection**: I developed an object detection system for the Camera Monitoring System(CMS) of car manufacturing products. This system uses deep learning to identify vehicles and other objects around the car using a camera mounted in the rearview mirrors.
   - **Semantic Segmentation**: I developed a system for automatically extracting people from video footage captured by surveillance cameras. This system uses a combination of computer vision techniques like background subtraction and deep learning to segment people from other objects in the scene.
   - **Face recognition**:  I developed a face recognition system that can identif people from high/low-angle images, such as those captured by surveillance cameras. This system was trained on a large dataset of human faces, and it can accurately identify people even in challenging conditions like poor lightining and occulusion.
   - **Anomalous behavior detections**: I developed a system for detecting anomalous behavior in video footage. This system uses a deep learning-based model to learn the patterns of normal behavior and identify any deviations from these patterns.

Research on Graph Signal Processing  
Collaborate with: Professor Antonio Ortegaã</summary>

   Graph Signal Processing(GSP) is a mathematical technique for processing signals defined on networks(graphs). Conventional sigal processing deals with signals with regular structures such s time and space, while graph signal processing deals with signals with non-structures such as social networks and transportation networks.
   We applied this technology to manufactring and successfully developed a system that automatically classifies videos of human assembly movements into individual work steps. The system uses a graph that represents the bones of the human hand and can also be used to detect abnormalities in assembly work.

<summary>April 2015 - March 2021, Research Scientist/Engineer, Mitsubishi Electric  
   
Image Analytics and Processing Technology Group,  
Smart Information Processing Technology Dept.  
INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY R&D CENTER  </summary>
   
   I developed a variety of computer vision technologies: 
   - **Training Data Minimization**: A state-of-the-art object detector was implemented and evaluated using a dataset of approximately 30,000 infrared images for person tracking. The object detector was trained using only RGB images and applied inference after converting the appearance of infrared images to RGB. The proposed method achieved an average precision of 83.3% and an average detection success rate of 63.3%, demonstrating high-accuracy person tracking.
   - **Knowledge Graph Visualization**: We applied Scene Graph, which describes the relationships between objects in a video, to production site footage to extract the tacit knowledge and experience-based actions of workers. In addition, we developed an attention mechanism that inputs the spatial position of objects in the channel direction as a teacher signal and confirmed that it can recognize objects with higher accuracy than the latest object recognition technology.
   - **Online Learning**: We developed a prototype system that can automatically extract learning targets from customer-accumulated information, enabling continuous improvement of AI recognition accuracy over time. We also identified the issue of low performance when not retraining on inference-side data for the Semantic Segmentation task. By adopting online learning and using background subtraction to generate and refine masks, they demonstrated the ability to perform high-precision inference without inference-side training data.
   - **Object Detection**: Small objects are difficult to detect due to the limited amount of information they contain in images. Additionally, in some datasets, small objects are often not annotated, leading to poor learning efficiency. To address these challenges, we developed a mechanism using attention to efficiently collect and acquire information from small objects and integrated it into an object detection system. The system was intended for integration into an electronic mirror (camera monitoring system) as a vehicle-mounted device.
   - **Driving Warning System**: This project aimed to develop an intelligent alert system that combines CMS (camera monitoring system) object recognition technology to assess surrounding vehicle risks with DMS (driver monitoring system) driver information to optimize alert methods, notification content, and notification timing for each driver. The system integrates camera-based sensing of driver information and external risks with AI technology to create an intelligent alert system that adjusts notification levels based on driver awareness.
   - **AI on device system**: A prototype system was developed to perform real-time object recognition on electronic mirror images and display the recognition results on the electronic mirror display. The demo system was showcased at CES2020 to introduce the company's AI technology to car manufacturers and enhance its presence in the industry. The system achieved an average recognition rate of 88.8% under various weather conditions.
   - **Optimizer**: We proposed a novel general-purpose optimizer and demonstrated its effectiveness through preliminary experiments on an object recognition dataset that was previously difficult to converge using conventional methods. The proposed method automatically adjusts the learning rate, enabling the optimizer to focus on learning rare and important information more effectively. Additionally, the method prevents overfitting during the initial training phase by stabilizing the gradient field.
   - **Attentive Notifications for Drivers**: This project involved integrating the company's proprietary object detection technology into a prototype vehicle. The real-time object recognition technology was applied to an ultra-wide-angle 360Â° camera to detect objects in the vehicle's blind spots and alert the driver. The system linked the object recognition results from the external camera with driver information obtained from the DMS (Driver Monitoring System) for notification. The technology was announced in a press release.
   - **Optical Character Recognition**: We developed AI technology that was applied to OCR and symbol recognition, and advanced image processing was used to improve detection and recognition rates. In response to a request for the introduction of a conversion system in the second half of the year, a system was built and provided that automates part of the conversion process using AI processing and allows users to perform conversion processing using a GUI tool. A paper symbol recognition technology using deep learning was developed and achieved a recognition rate of 98%. For OCR technology, fine-tuning was also performed and a recognition rate of 99% was achieved.
   - **Document Alignment**: In this project, I developed and deployed an automated financial document position correction system. The software takes as input a set of images captured or scanned by a camera and projects the positions of all images onto the appearance of a front-facing shot. After the software was provided, a new challenge of improving speed was identified, and the system was incorporated into a simple system that estimates an external rectangle.
   - **Action Recognition**: We were engaged in collaborative research with Takenaka Corporation and serves as the technical representative for Takenaka Technical Research Institute's open technology demonstrations. They have developed a system that utilizes sensors to identify and visualize human active behaviors (affirmation, negation, and smiling) using HoloLens.
   - **Anomaly Detection**: I evaluated a Deep Learning-based person detection method using data from surveillance cameras on actual railway vehicles and conducted a feasibility study. I also developed a low-compute method for crowd analysis and participated in meetings with railway operators to discuss the feasibility of using Deep Learning. In addition, I constructed an algorithm for detecting suspicious objects in station premises and vehicles and developed a system with visualizing pedestrian.
